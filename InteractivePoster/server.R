              However, this is the reality now across the majority of social science courses offered in the UK, as teaching of quantitative research methods becomes thoroughly and properly
              embedded into course curricula. But this was not always the case, and the volume and quality of this teaching and learning has improved rapidly and dramatically in a 
              very short space of time. As such, the pedogogy of how to fuse methods teaching with this intensity within 'soft science' subjects is very much fresh and growing.", "<br> <br>",

              This is down to the the Q-Step initiative, a Â£19.5m programme funded by the Nuffield Foundation (supported by the ESRC) from 2013-2021. This was launched
              as a 'systematic response to the shortage of quantitatively-skilled social science graduates', with the aim of bringing the teaching of computational 
              research methods into the heart of social science programmes across the country. This initiative sparked a complete change in the manner and depth
              with which quantitative, computational research methods were taught in undergraduate programmes. <b>81</b> degree programmes and <b>236 modules</b> 
              have spun out from the programme to date.")

               it will remain, but without the guaranteed funding, it is up to them to make their courses sustainable and to UK universities to maintain the embedding of methods training into
               undergraduate social science programmes. In order to do this, quantitative methods educators must answer some tough questions.", "<br> <br>",

              gateway, learners may be able to progress in practical terms on their course with an unsophisticated and underdeveloped knowledge base, but they will lack fundamental
              perceptions and thinking which leads to holistic and <em>transferrable</em> (i.e. the learner can take what they have learned from the taught example and properly apply
              it with confidence and accuracy to other scenarios) understanding (Land and Meyer, 2003; Cousin, 2006; Land, Meyer, and Smith, 2008).",  "<br> <br>",

              <em>all of the above?</em> As educators, we need measurements and theories of our own about these potential moments and how much of a threshold they constitute. My assessment submission will (hopefully) formalise these into
